# About evroc
Founded to power a digital Europe, evroc is building a secure, sovereign and sustainable hyperscale cloud that will put an end to the foreign dominance of the European cloud market.

## The Challenge
The lack of competitive home-grown cloud providers poses a serious challenge for Europe. Not only because citizens’ data is placed under foreign ownership by companies operating under laws that conflict with European privacy legislation. It also poses a real threat to Europe’s long-term competitiveness in a world where the United States and China are advancing much faster. Foreign cloud companies end up doing little software and hardware development in Europe. This keeps the positive ripple effects and value creation for the economy outside of the EU.

## Sustainability
evroc will build the first hyperscale cloud for Europe while doing right by the climate. The significant carbon footprint caused by data centers powered by fossil fuels needs to be addressed. Data centers consume about 3% of the global electricity supply and account for 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions. That puts the data center industry on par with the airline industry.  
The evroc cloud will leverage the next generation of energy-efficient technologies for maximum sustainability impact. evroc’s proprietary eco stack will enable customers to have data flow seamlessly and securely between its sovereign European data centers based on where renewable energy is most readily available and affordable. Together with other energy-efficiency innovations, this will make evroc the world’s cleanest cloud.

## Ecosystem
A competitive European hyperscale cloud will keep investments, job creation, technology development and intellectual property rights within Europe’s borders. A European built and owned hyperscale cloud will also generate wider, technology ecosystem effects transforming all sectors of the economy. By creating the first real European hyperscale cloud, evroc will inject world-class entrepreneurship and sky-high ambitions into a European tech scene in need of an adrenaline shot and a confidence boost. The next generation of European tech companies will be built on evroc’s cloud services – on the back of its position as a catalyst for the digital ecosystem.
